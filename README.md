# Customer-Segmentatio
This dashboard helped me explore customer patterns and product performance using real-world eCommerce data. I combined Python for data cleaning and Power BI for data storytelling—turning rows of raw data into actionable insights for decision-makers.
Here’s what I uncovered: 📈 Over $8.3M in sales visualized across time, products, and regions
🛒 Identified the top 10 best-selling products by both quantity and revenue
📆 Tracked monthly sales trends, revealing seasonal buying behavior
👥 Analyzed over 4,300 customers and found a 65.58% repeat purchase rate
🎯 Grouped customers by loyalty tiers (Loyal, Engaged, Occasional, One-Time) for smarter marketing strategy
🏆 Highlighted the top 10 high-value customers contributing significantly to overall revenue
This wasn’t just about charts and KPIs—it was about building a narrative that connects data to business goals. I wanted every visualization to answer a clear question and help a team take action faster.
